            "answer": "<p>We recommend to consume freshly roasted coffee within 3 months of their roast date.<br\/><br\/>This is to ensure that you get the best brewing experience out of your coffee! We find that the aromas and flavours are optimal when coffee is within this period.<br\/><br\/>Once roasted, coffee will gradually lose its flavours intensity and go stale the more it is exposed to the elements (think oxygen, humidity, heat, light). Therefore, it is best to consume it as soon as possible, or at least in an airtight container - limiting the exposure to the environment.<br\/><br\/>We don't recommend keeping your coffee for longer than a year. So, drink up and enjoy the brew!<\/p>"

The certification process for organic (and similarly for Fairtrade coffees) can be a hefty additional cost to farmers, many of whom cannot afford to get the certification.<\/p>"

            "question": "Are your coffees considered “specialty coffee”?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes, they are Specialty graded coffees!<br\/><br\/>Specialty coffees are only deemed as such if they receive a Quality Score of more than 80 from the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). The Quality Score is based on a scale of 100 and is judged on a variety of factors, which include sweetness, acidity, balance, mouthfeel and flavour. BlueTown Coffee only ever buys beans that score 85 and above! <br\/><br\/>In terms of Varietal, it's not so simple as 'just' Arabica or Robusta.<br\/><br\/>Coffee is an ancient plant, with different varietals and genes dating hundreds of years back. Some varietals are natural cross-bred with Arabica and Robusta strains, while some are intentionally crossed to be hybrids, to improve yield and disease resistance.<br\/><br\/>Bottomline is: You can expect only the best coffees from us.<\/p>"

            "question": "Why should I brew my own coffee?",
            "answer": "<p>The most common objection we get to brewing your own specialty coffee at home is that it's just too much work.<br\/><br\/>Yes, great coffee at home may requires a bit more effort than instant coffee or a grab-and-go from a cafe, but it can be so worth it! Here's why:<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Money Saving<\/strong><br\/><br\/>This is an obvious one. While we can't compete on pricing with instant coffees (since we only offer the highest quality specialty-grade Arabica beans that are freshly roasted every week), brewing your own coffee is much more economical than visiting a cafe for your brew. <br\/><br\/><strong>2. Mugs and Re-usables are better for the environment<\/strong><br\/><br\/>A takeaway coffee every day is 365 paper cups in the bin every year. Just, don't, please.<br\/><br\/><strong>3. You can be as fussy as you like, or as experimental as you like<\/strong><br\/><br\/>Only you know exactly how you like your coffee. Doing it yourself means you get to tweak it exactly how you want it. You also get to experiment with different beans and brew methods, to keep things exciting or nail down your preferences.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. It can be a personal ritual, but also a social activity<\/strong><br\/><br\/>While brewing coffee at home is usually a therapeutic ritual customised to our own idiosyncracies, brewing coffee can also be a social activity. Whether you've invited some friends over, or have flatmates that you share common living spaces with, brewing coffee for someone else can be both an act of generosity and a great conversation lubricant.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>There's so many ways of brewing coffee, differing from country to country, culture to culture.<br\/><br\/>One of the most common brew methods that we use are:<br\/><br\/><strong>Drip<\/strong> - Drippers such as the Hario V60 is a beloved brew method by coffee lovers and baristas around the world.  With the use of a paper filter, it produces a clean, transparent cup that is light bodied - perfect for analysing the different nuances.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>French Press\/Plunger<\/strong> - One of the most 'old school' coffee brewers there is, brewing with the French Press is fuss-free and simple. It produces a full-bodied cup with added richness.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Aeropress<\/strong> - One of the most popular coffee brewer in recent times, the Aeropress is fun, easy-to-use, and versatile! There's many recipes and styles to brew on the Aeropress. You can achieve consistent and fuller bodied mouthfeel (by way of Immersion) while the included paper filters keep your brews clean.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Cold Brew<\/strong> - Perfect for those hot, humid days. Cold Brew coffees are smooth, easy to drink, and easy to brew. All you need is a container, coffee, water and time.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Espresso<\/strong> - Everyone loves a good cup of espresso. Words to describe the perfect espresso; rich, smooth, intense, sweet. Espresso is the base of so many drinks that we love; Long Black, Cappuccino, Flat White.<\/p>"
